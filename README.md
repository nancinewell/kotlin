# Overview

I am interested in Kotlin as it is a language I've heard about recently that is used in making Android mobile apps.

This particular piece of software is a simple Random Event Generator. You can create, modify, delete, and display events, and roll a random event on demand.

We use random events in our homeschool daily, so it is useful to me to create something that we will definitely use. This is a small part of a larger project to gamify our school day.

# Development Environment

After several hours of trying to get my comfortable Visual Studio Code to work with Kotlin, researching, and consulting a professional, I learned the while VS Code can be used with Kotlin, it's not very friendly to Kotlin, and I would be better served by using a development environment that is built for Kotlin. I switched to Android Studio. This environment is new to me, and I had to take some time learning how to use it. It has worked well. The project management set up exposed me to some pieces of Kotlin that I don't think I would have encountered during my initial learning phase, so I'm grateful for the extra rabbit holes. 

From the consultation, I also learned that Kotlin tutorials are notorious for not including the imports you will need when using their tutorials. However, I did come across a very helpful tip in a video that explained a shortcut in Android Studio that will automatically import the things you need based on the commands you used. (Android Studio Tutorial (2024 Edition)). I believe everything I used came from the Kotlin Standard Library.

# Future Work
- Storage. Something like this should be connected to a database to store all of the events.
- Graphic Interface. Currently, this prints everything to the command line. It needs a graphic interface to be truly functional and user friendly. 
- Mobile App. I'd love to use this in our homeschool, no matter where we are. Simply pulling out my phone to get at it would be ideal.
